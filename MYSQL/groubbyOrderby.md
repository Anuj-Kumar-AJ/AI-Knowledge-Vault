# GROUP BY statement

It is more then DISTINCT , meaning. when we use DISTINCT lets say on gender column, then it returns Male and female only. 
but when we use GROUP BY, it will group all the rows in male and female

`SELECT * 
From tableName 
GROUP BY gender `


# ORDER By Satatement


It will arrange the row data in certain order as per request

`SELECT *
From tableName
Order BY salary DEC` --> this code will arrange the data in decreasing order of salary
